# ConfirmLanguageSettingsAfterAutopilot
Confirm or modify timezone, OS language and/or keyboard layout after Autopilot

I got the idea from Niall Brady’s great script “Prompting standard users to confirm or change Regional, Time Zone, and Country settings after Windows Autopilot enrollment is complete.”

Thank you, Niall, for this outstanding solution! Here is the link to the original post:

Objective: After the Autopilot process, the user is presented with a prompt displaying the currently configured time zone, operating system language, and keyboard layout. The user can either confirm or adjust these settings.
